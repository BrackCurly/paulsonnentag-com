<div class="project-description">
Our team developed smart mirror during the <a href="http://www.oktoberhackfest.com/">Oktoberhackfest</a>.
The project is inspired by <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/magic-mirror/">magic mirror</a>.
Instead of a Raspberry Pi we used an Android smartphone which is placed behind a one-way mirror.
The smartphone is connected to a digital scale in front of the mirror. The scale tracks the users weight history.
Based on the weight it's also possible to differentiate between different users and allow them to customize the
information that is displayed for them, like their next appointment.
