A few weeks ago I bought myself a smart watch. I don't have a need for it
but I think smart watches are really interesting devices to experiment with and develop for.
There are some areas where they're currently useful like notifications, fitnestracking or navigation.
Overall they still feel gimicky and imature. A lot of apps for Android Wear are just scaled down
version of regular apps like a [calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rocketstartups.wearcalculator), [browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appfour.wearbrowser) and of corse the obligatory [flappy bird clone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.maui.flopsydroid). They don't fit the form factor and interaction model of a smart watch.

Smart watches require a completely new kind of app. Most mobile apps are highly interactive and allow complex inputs. Smart watches on the other hand are very limited in regard to screen size, performance and input methods. But there is one advantage smart watches have over other mobile devices and that is context. No other device is so close to the user. You can find out where she is, where she looks, how she is moving and a lot of other things if you're using smart heuristic e.g. she's connected to her home wifi so she must be at home. The limited ui and the great amount of context we know about the user enables us to create the best app imaginable: one that just does what the user wants without requireing any interaction at all. If you can't solve your problem with an app that only relies on user context and little to no user interaction than you shouldn't target a smart watch.

To illustrate what I mean here are two examples of apps that should exist for smart watches

**Find my Car**: The app tracks the users speed in the background. If the user transitions from driving speed to walking speed the app will remember that location as parking spot. It then adds a card with the time how long it will take to get back to the car. From the card the user can also start a navigation back to her car.

**Stuff around you**: Based on the location and the direction you're looking the app finds matches with an database of known places. If there is a match and you look at your watch it'll display relevant information about the place. For famous buildings it could be the height and when it was build. For shops and restaurants it could display user ratings and opening times. If the shop is closed it could suggest similar shops close by.
