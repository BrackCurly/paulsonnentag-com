<div class="project-description">
Swip was developed for <a href="http://www.inno-hacks.de/">Inno{Hacks}</a>. It's an experiment to create multi
device applications by giving smarphones the ability to be physically connected and know how they are spacially related.
This works with a simple swipe gesture which triggers a event on each device. If the server
detects two swipe events in opposite directions at the same time the two devices are
connected at the point where the swipe gesture was executed. When a device detects movement
it's disconnected again.
